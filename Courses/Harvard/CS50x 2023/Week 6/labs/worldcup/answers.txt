Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The smallest simulation count determines the probability (inaccurate) for only the best teams. The number of tournaments is not sufficient to create an accurate model.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After running 100 times, the results are inaccurate, but a preliminary level can be inferred. After running 1000 times, the data is pretty accurate, so I would choose this one.
